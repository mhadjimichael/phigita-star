   basic drawing program is working
   but, need to do better abstraction of drawing area (a drawable)
     note: drawables can overlap, allowing multiple axes on same area, 
           little blowups, etc.
   (there can be more than one on a canvas)
   also, axes are just decoration, should be possible
     to easily plant more than one, decorate differently, etc.

   initial versions of most everything
   missing: labels! 
     can't think of elegant way to incorporate this into each PlotXXX routine
     basically, just want some "example" of how to draw something, but this is 
     a pain given lots of different styles of drawing, filling, etc.
   really, what is needed is the ability to 
     draw a single bar
     draw a single point
     etc.
   in the correct "style"
