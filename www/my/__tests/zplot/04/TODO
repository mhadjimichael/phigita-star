:: TODO :: 

text placement
    need to better understand offsets for vertical positioning
    (especially when text is rotated, for example)

legend
    basic legend service (horizontal, vertical, etc.)
    placement control
    integration with styles (and patterns)

styles
    a way to talk about the "style" used for each of a set of lines/bars/etc.
    and then an easy way to use this exact info in the legend

plots
    lineplots: need a simple way to make these, and a bunch of styles if
        points are used (and legend interaction)
    boxplots
    all sorts of styles of plots

database
    more ability to manipulate data
    standard deviations
    mins, maxes

bar styles
    more bar styles, including circles, boxes, stars, diag lines, ...
    generic fill service, used by boxes, circles, polyshapes, etc.
    labeled bars: easy way to add numbers to the top of the bars

axis
    better interface and arguments -- after all, it is just a line
    autosetting based on table values
    logscale and other things like that

tics
    simpler interface to get the "default" behavior


:: DONE ::

scaling/translating
    needs to be fixed (doesn't work for non-zero mins)

labels
    more flexible label service
    (subsumes, title, xlabel, ylabel)
