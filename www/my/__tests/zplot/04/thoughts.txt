a drawable is a named thing, should other things be named too?
e.g., an "axis", which thus would have "properties" ?
e.g., a linewidth, etc., which others can look up?

but, defaults have to be "nice"
  meaning, someone can use this and "not know" about it

an axis is always on a drawable, but clearly there can be multiple axes per drawable
  usually, one x and one y axis
  hence, (drawable,x) and (drawable,y) would be fine names
  this would give a way to look up the properties of the thing by the ticmark maker

what about label maker, who wants to look up properties of both the axis and the tic marks?
  ugh, named tic marks seem horrible
