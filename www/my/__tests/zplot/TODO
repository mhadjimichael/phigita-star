:: TODO :: 

code
    error handling
        just want to print the right message when something goes wrong ...
    finish horizontal bar plots (needed?)
Write documentation paper
    Move examples, docs to web page

*Fix pattern thing: params -> size and skip
*Test legend support for all types
*breaks in a graph - how to do this nicely?
*Map categories -> numbers (table, axis)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Plot*Intervals (and other routines)
    add limits (chop off intervals)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

new way of mapping categories onto tables
    just do it in a table routine
    then, enable label,num pairs to be imported from a table

legends
    finish legend support in all known plot routines
    finish up support for horizontal bar plots 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ps
    text that includes linebreaks (e.g., <br> symbol or something)
        (alternate: specify number of characters to wrap after)
    still must interact properly with anchors!
    also, subscripts and superscripts and change of fonts in-line and ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------

drawable
    category: how to allow for slightly bigger axis 
    category: how to map to offcenter point
       (e.g., one data set at A+delta,y* :: the other at A-delta,y* )
       for entire category, this is probably easy: specify argument to Drawable -xscalearg {0.5}
       and thus the entire thing will be shifted by that amount
       BUT, what a pain to do for multiple data sets
       can we update this 'scalearg' during execution? 
           e.g., now, change it to XXX? DrawableSetScaleArg -drawable drawable -axis axis -value 0.3

newaxis
    doUnpackDescription:: 
      how many decimal places for the floating point format: guess better (low priority)

Algorithms
    FindStep: how to automatically determine steps between a min,max

drawable
    dateplots

demos
    for demos, make many small graphs with variations
	e.g. all the different bar types, colors, point types, etc.
    can make this programmatic: 
        foreach point type (x y z)
            make a drawable, draw the same data with this new point type

args
    generic way to deal with fixed list of args ... (e.g,, 'style' field of PlotPoints)
    better message when something is not correct (print warning, then print help message of routine)

styles
    a way to talk about the "style" used for each of a set of lines/bars/etc.
    and then an easy way to use this exact info in the legend

database
    student-t when doing devs, etc.

random and unlikely
    autosize the canvas (optionally) based on how big the whole thing was
    similarly, allow size to change after its done
    don't allow lines, etc., to be drawn if they are off the canvas
      (can this be done with some kind of clipping in postscript?)

********************************************************************************

:: DONE ::

axis
    better interface and arguments -- after all, it is just a line

tics
    simpler interface to get the "default" behavior

scaling/translating
    needs to be fixed (doesn't work for non-zero mins)

labels
    more flexible label service
    (subsumes, title, xlabel, ylabel)

text placement
    need to better understand offsets for vertical positioning
    (especially when text is rotated, for example)

legend
    basic legend service (horizontal, vertical, etc.)
    placement control

plots
    lineplots: need a simple way to make these, and a bunch of styles if
        points are used (and legend interaction)
    boxplots
    all sorts of styles of plots

database
    more ability to manipulate data
    standard deviations
    mins, maxes

axis
    autosetting based on table values

bar styles
    more bar styles, including circles, boxes, stars, diag lines, ...
    generic fill service, used by boxes, circles, polyshapes, etc.
    labeled bars: easy way to add numbers to the top of the bars

drawable
    logplots
    justplainwordplots (add TableMap feature? takes column of words, makes new column of numbers with mapping)
        (but how can we extract the mapping to draw the labels on the axis? hence, bad idea)

table
    add ability to have multiword entries with "separator" feature (e.g., ":")

Algorithms
    Location: how to place xlabel, ylabel, title automagically
