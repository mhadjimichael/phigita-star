text placement
    - need to handle vertical placement too
      (anchor right now is just left, right, or center,
       but needs a top and down component)

legend
    - basic legend service (horizontal, vertical, etc.)
    - placement control
    - integration with styles

styles
    a way to talk about the "style" used for each of a set of lines/bars/etc.
    and then an easy way to use this exact info in the legend

lineplots
    need a simple way to make these, and a bunch of styles if
    points are used (and legend interaction)

bar styles
    more bar styles, including circles, boxes, stars, diag lines, ...

labels
    basic label service
    also, title still needs work to be complete

axis
    more control over axis (e.g., tufte like shadowing)
    autosetting 

ticks
    more control over tick marks, tick labels
