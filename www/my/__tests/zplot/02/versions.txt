   basic drawing program is working
   but, need to do better abstraction of drawing area (a drawable)
     note: drawables can overlap, allowing multiple axes on same area, 
           little blowups, etc.
   (there can be more than one on a canvas)
   also, axes are just decoration, should be possible
     to easily plant more than one, decorate differently, etc.
