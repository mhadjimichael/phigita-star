01
   basic drawing program is working
   but, need to do better abstraction of drawing area (a drawable)
     note: drawables can overlap, allowing multiple axes on same area, 
           little blowups, etc.
   (there can be more than one on a canvas)
   also, axes are just decoration, should be possible
     to easily plant more than one, decorate differently, etc.
  
02
   initial versions of most everything
   missing: labels! 
     can't think of elegant way to incorporate this into each PlotXXX routine
     basically, just want some "example" of how to draw something, but this is 
     a pain given lots of different styles of drawing, filling, etc.
   really, what is needed is the ability to 
     draw a single bar
     draw a single point
     etc.
   in the correct "style"

03
   added namespaces
   working on Axis2 (simple unified axis command)
   working on PsPolygon (generic fillable polygon)

04
   rudimentary simple AxisTicsLabels command
   added PsPolygon
   added '-fill' option to PlotLines (allowed for filled underlines)
   added '-file' option to PsRender
   added better pattern support for all Ps* commands (including polygon)
   added more demo scripts: make-filled make-linespoints

05
   added a bunch of stuff, I can't even remember what
   fixed PlotLines to avoid having to gather up a long list of points and then plot them
   plot:  added PlotFunction, PlotVerticalIntervals, PlotVerticalFill (moving some of this out of PlotLines)
   table: added routines to compute mean, add columns, do math over a column, and so forth
   <<what else?>>
   scripts: do 'ls -l 04/make*.tcl' and 'ls -l 05/make*.tcl' 
     and marvel at the difference
