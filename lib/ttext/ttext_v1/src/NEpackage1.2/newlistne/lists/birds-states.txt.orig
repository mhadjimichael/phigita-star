   Webmaster Notes:
   The pages shown depicting the official 50 US State birds were drawn
   from : "Audubon's Birds of America" an 1840 "First Octavo Edition" of
   John J. Audubon's complete seven volume text.

   Within the text you will see many names in capital letters. This was
   the convention that Audubon himself used in his text to set off
   proper names. We have preserved this convention in our text. Due to
   the inability of the ASCII character set to print Greek letters, the
   Greek words that Audubon used in his Family and Genus descriptions
   have been "Latinized": the letters delta-iota-sigma, for example,
   have become [dis]; the square brackets indicate that the editors have
   made this change.

   A special thank-you goes to Mr. Richard Buonanno, who originally
   converted the Bird's of America complete text, with references, to
   HTML format. The 50states.com website utilizes 29 files from Mr.
   Buonanno's collection
