SELDOM has there been such a divorce between the way a political leader is viewed by outsiders and how he is seen by his own people. Abroad, �varo Uribe, Colombia's president since August 2002, is viewed by many as a fascistic ogre in league with right-wing paramilitaries to trample human rights. Most Colombians, by contrast, reckon their president has improved their human rights, by starting to tame three irregular armies with tough security policies. Polls show some 80% of respondents approve of Mr Uribe.

That has prompted his supporters to propose an amendment to Colombia's constitution to allow a sitting president to seek a second, consecutive, term. A sensible move, many might say. Four years are too few to deal with Colombia's formidable problems. Having found a president of whom they approve (the previous two disappointed), surely Colombians should have the chance to keep him there for a bit longer?

That argument is tempting, but flawedthough not for the reasons advanced from afar. On human rights, on balance, Mr Uribe is vindicated. He contends that the democratic state must impose its authority on the far-flung reaches of a country twice the size of France and of impossible geography. To do this, he has pursued the left-wing FARC guerrillas energetically, sent police to 158 municipalities that lacked them, and created part-time peasant soldiers to improve rural security. The result: murders and kidnaps have fallen sharply. 

The record is not without blemish. Mr Uribe's peace talks with the paramilitaries have looked like an effort to pardon their leaders, who include mass murderers and drug traffickers. Killings of trade-unionists and of human-rights activists by paramilitaries remain shamefully commonif less so than they were. Yet he is not to blame, as some claim, for the appalling plight of Ingrid Betancourt, a Colombian politician who was kidnapped by the FARC two years ago (see article). Rightly, Mr Uribe sees a humanitarian exchange (the Orwellian term of its promoters) of Ms Betancourt and other hostages for guerrilla prisoners as a recipe for more kidnappings.



Checking over-mighty executives
Yet Colombia would still be rash to allow Mr Uribe's re-election as long as its democracy remains unconsolidated. Faced with exceptional violence, Mr Uribe has reached for some exceptional measures. An anti-terrorism law gives the armed forces sweeping judicial powers of arrest and interrogation. Another bill would give the president power to choose the attorney-general (currently picked by Congress) and restrict the powers of the courts to challenge the executive.

Some of these measures are justified, but others are not. The weakening of checks and balances would be even more worrying if combined with a two-term presidency. Mr Uribe would have the potential, should he wish, to turn himself into an elected autocrat, along the lines of Hugo Ch�ez next door in Venezuela or, in the 1990s, Alberto Fujimori in Peru.

Colombia's legalism has long sat awkwardly with its lawlessness. But its traditional suspicion of over-mighty executives has also been a hidden strength in a region where caudillos thrive. In 1991, Colombia loosened its ban on re-election: a president can seek a second term but not consecutively. That remains a wise balance. Many of Mr Uribe's policies deserve to be continued (and improved upon) by a successor. Better four years of success than eight or more that end in tears.
