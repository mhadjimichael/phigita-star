Taiwan's elections, seen from the mainland

FOUR years ago, China's then prime minister, Zhu Rongji, angrily warned voters in Taiwan that they wouldn't get another opportunity to regret it if they elected Chen Shui-bian, a supporter of the island's independence from China, as president. Mr Zhu's finger-wagging failed to deter them and on March 20th voters will have another opportunity: to re-elect Mr Chen or choose his opponent Lien Chan, who favours closer ties with China. This time China's attempts to influence the closely fought presidential race have been a little subtler. 

At a rare news conference on March 14th, Mr Zhu's successor, Wen Jiabao, avoided threats of war. Instead he quoted lines from two Taiwanese authors expressing regret at the island's separation from China. Only when the blood of the native son flows back to his native place will it stop boiling, went one of them. About the strongest words he could summon to condemn Mr Chen (though not by name) were that the Taiwan leader's decision to hold a referendum on cross-strait issues at the same time as the election had threatened stability in the Taiwan Strait region. The remark is similar to those used by the United States, France, the European Union and Japan.


Chinese officials and the country's state-controlled media have also attacked the referendum as an attempt to set a precedent for an eventual vote on the island's formal independence from China. The referendum asks whether Taiwan should boost its defences in response to China's missile build-up and whether the island should hold peace talks with the mainland. But apart from the usual fulminations on internet bulletin boards (a haven for China's most ardent nationalists), there has been little sign on the mainland of great public concern about the issue. 

This week, the government-affiliated Social Survey Institute of China published the results of an opinion poll on Taiwan's referendum conducted in cities around China. Curiously, more than 20% of the 2,150 respondents said they weren't interested. Li Dongmin, the institute's director, says that 5.6% even expressed tolerance of the idea of Taiwan's independence. This is a remarkable finding in a country where the government allows no questioning of its territorial claims, and a person's views on the Taiwan issue are regarded as a key test of patriotism. 

Could it be that China's nationalists are going off the boil? Certainly many urban Chinese, when asked, support the idea of military action against Taiwan, should it declare independence. But for all the Chinese media's condemnations of Mr Chen as a traitor, grievances about his policies are far less likely to trigger public protests than are perceived provocations by Japan. This is partly a result of the government's fears that giving rein to public sentiment on Taiwan could force it to adopt a more confrontational approach, which would risk conflict with America and serious damage to the economy. Anti-Japanese protests are somewhat more tolerable because even the fiercest critics of Japan in China do not call for all-out war. 

Mr Li says the government's own failure to articulate a clear-cut view on the referendum issuebeyond repetition of well-known formulas opposing independencemay also explain why some are becoming indifferent. Nationalist sentiment in China is shaped to a considerable degree by government attitudes. Few, for example, show any interest in taking Mongolia, which China regards as independent but which Taiwan officially regards as part of Chinese territory.

If Taiwan ever does declare formal independence, the risk of war would be considerablehence the concerns expressed by several western governments about the referendum (or rather, what it could portend). But this week, French and Chinese destroyers staged joint manoeuvres off the Chinese coast, the Chinese navy's biggest ever with a foreign country, according to the Chinese press. Taiwan expressed displeasure, but the exercise, as well as a goodwill port call to Shanghai by the command ship of America's Pacific fleet in February, suggested that for all the rhetoric, there is little immediate risk of conflict.
