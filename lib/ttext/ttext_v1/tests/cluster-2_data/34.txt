Communist money pays off capitalist debt

ROOSEVELT SKERRIT, Dominica's 31-year-old prime minister, has plenty
of reasons to be cheerful. Three months into office, he scored a
landslide win in a by-election on April 5th. And last week, China
promised him $122m in return for revoking his country's recognition of
Taiwan. The switch will bring in more than a third of his government's
normal revenue, for five yearsst cash. As eco-tourism and agriculture
have drifted, Dominica has sold passports, hosted offshore banks and
voted alongside Japan for commercial whaling. But playing off Taiwan
and China is the favourite local game. 

The stakes are high, and competition fierce. Elsewhere in the world,
Macedonia, Nauru and Liberia have recently gone over to Beijing. In
the Caribbean, the Bahamas (which has a big Hong Kong-owned container
port), and St Lucia (which had a new government) defected in
1997. Kiribati, in the Pacific, plumped for Taiwan last year.

Dame Eugenia Charles, one of Mr Skerrit's predecessors, chose Taiwan
in 1983 out of political conviction. For 21 years, Taiwan repaid her
with small-scale aid projects, such as the occasional gift of police
cars and help with new crops. For this, says Mr Skerrit, his country
still ha s. Bu tthe hurricane belt, and has around a 25% chance of
enduring a big volcanic eruption within 25 years. Two prime ministers
have died since the last election in 2000. 

But even the Chinese gift won't solve all of Dominica's
problems. China often sends its own labourers to man overseas
construction projects. Dominica will still be in debt, much of it
borrowed at commercial rates from unforgiving banks. The IMF and
others have been working on their own aid programmes, but with tedious
conditions, such as more civil-service pay cuts. 

The Taiwanese are not beaten yet: St Vincent, Grenada and St Kitts &
Nevis, among others, still recognise them. Actually, Nevis
(population: 10,000) wants to secede from St Kitts; a referendum is
planned for later this year. If China stumps up another $122m,
independence might become affordable.
