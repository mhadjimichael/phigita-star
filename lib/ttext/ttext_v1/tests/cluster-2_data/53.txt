The chancellor was right, and most observers were wrong, about economic growth. He's gambling that the same is true of the public finances

GORDON BROWN'S eighth budget was about politics, not economics. Given how fast the budget deficit has been growing, a prudent custodian of the public finances would be raising taxes or cutting spending. But, with an election likely next year, neither was uppermost in Mr Brown's mind. Instead, he kept his budget neutral, stayed rather quiet about the state of the public finances and had a great deal to say about the economy. 

The economy is Labour's biggest electoral asset. Mr Brown made the most of it, and of the fact that his prediction for the economy in 2003, which many thought over-optimistic, turned out to be spot on. The Treasury now expects above-trend growth in 2004 and 2005. 

Clearly there are risks to this forecastespecially that higher interest rates will prick Britain's housing bubble. The record trade gap in January was an uncomfortable reminder that the economy remains unbalanced, with the recovery driven by domestic demand rather than exports. For the time being, though, Mr Brown's record of economic stability remains intact.

But if the economy is strong, the public finances are not. Four years ago, at a similar point in the electoral cycle, Mr Brown's fiscal position was impregnable, with a surplus of 15 billion ($27 billion). Now he has a deficit of 38 billion3.4% of GDP. He is forecasting deficits of 33 billion in 2004-05 and 31 billion the year after. 

On the face of it, deficits on this scale argue for tax increases or spending cuts, but Mr Brown maintains that much of the deficit is cyclical, not structural. If he is wrong, he should be tightening fiscal policy now. Failing to do so will mean more pain later.

Mr Brown's main fiscal rule is to balance the current budget (which excludes investment) over the cycle, which runs from 1999 to 2005 according to the Treasury. The chancellor claims that he will still meet this golden rulealthough his comfort room has shrunk over the past year. However, John Hawksworth, economist at PWC, an accountancy firm, forecasts that he will narrowly miss it. 

 
 
 

 
The Treasury's optimism on the current budget is based on a rosy outlook for tax revenues. Without explicit tax-raising measures, it is forecasting a rise in the tax take from 37.8% of GDP in 2003-04 to 39.9% in 2006-07. This increase, worth over 20 billion in today's money, seems implausible even allowing for a likely cyclical recovery in tax revenues. Mr Hawksworth is particularly dubious about the Treasury's forecasts for corporation-tax receipts. 

Others are sceptical, too. In January, the OECD said that although the golden rule would just be met in the current cycle, a sizeable structural deficit would persist. Such warnings allow the Conservatives to talk of Labour's third-term tax rises. Replying to the chancellor's speech, Michael Howard, their leader, labelled Mr Brown the borrow now, tax later chancellor. 

Mr Brown, for his part, taunted the Conservatives about their plans to avoid tax increases by cutting departmental budgets outside health and education. Yet the centrepiece of his budget was a sharp slowdown in spending growth in two years' time (see chart). 

 
 
 

 
The squeeze on most departmental budgets will be intense, since the National Health Service will continue to get increases of over 7% a year until 2007-08. Mr Brown revealed that education will get a relatively generous settlement, but other ministers will get slimmer pickings. According to Mr Hawksworth, the remaining departments, including defence, transport and the Home Office, will be scrabbling over meagre increases in their budgets of around 1% a year.

No wonder Mr Brown has embraced the cause of greater government efficiency with such zeal. Last year, the chancellor asked Sir Peter Gershon, head of the Office of Government Commerce, to investigate the scope for economies from new technology and changes in working practices. The chancellor said in his budget speech that Sir Peter's report will unveil potential savings of 20 billion a year by 2008, and anticipated it by announcing thousands of civil service job cuts, including 30,000 from the Department of Work and Pensions alonea quarter of its workforce.

Civil-service unions, which were taken by surprise by the announcement, are horrified. But for Mr Brown, plans for cutting jobs seem not only to give him more fiscal room, but also help to skewer the Conservatives, who recently unveiled spending plans heavily dependent on cutting back a public sector workforce that has been expanding fast under Labour.

At the last election in 2001, the economy had been booming, the Treasury's coffers were overflowing and the government could pledge handsome increases in public spending. Come the next election, Labour will be able to capitalise again on a robust economy. But Mr Brown's budget reveals that the government will be on much shakier ground on the public finances and spending. That will make for a more even contest.
