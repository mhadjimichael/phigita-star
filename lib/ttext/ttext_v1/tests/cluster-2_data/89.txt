Yet more evidence of Martian water

THE X43A (see article) represents the firs t of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. But it is th e that NASA is best
known for, and which its publicity machine likes to keep in the public
eye. Water-on-Mars stories, which celebrate the success of the
agency's two rovers on the planet, are a good way of doing so. Another
one has just been released.

Evidence for, at the least, a salty pond, and possibly for a sea
having covered the area where the rover Opportunity is operating comes
in two parts. The first is that one of the rocks Opportunity has been
examining has bromide salts distributed throughout it in a manner
characteristic of what would happen if sea water were to evaporate on
Earth. The second is a detailed photograph of a geological feature
known as  a. When grains of sediment start to move in a current, they
tend to form little mounds that migrate downstream and then avalanche
over the grains in front of them. This produces sedimentary layering
at an angle to the surface the grains are moving on-in other words,
crossbedding. 

Crossbedding in the local rocks was first reported three weeks
ago. But, at that point it was not clear whether water or wind was the
cause. Close-up photography strongly suggests it was water.
