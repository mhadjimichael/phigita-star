The hydra bites

Al-Qaeda is not the beast it was before September 11th. But it is still deadly

FROM an unexploded bomb in a backpack to a tatty Madrid phone shop, and onwards to Morocco and beyond. The investigative trail from the March 11th bombings in Spain, though fuzzy, points to the involvement of Islamist fanatics, and now stretches over the Spanish borders. The Americans say that al-Qaeda itself was involved; Osama bin Laden, keen to portray himself as the vanguard of a global jihad, will doubtless be pleased with this conclusion. For westerners, the theory that Mr bin Laden had a hand in this and other recent attacks at least helps to make an otherwise mystifying enemy seem comprehensible. But is it credible?

Perhaps. Jamal Zougam, a Moroccan arrested in Spain last week, is thought to be an associate of Abu Dahdah, who was himself believed, until his arrest in late 2001, to have been al-Qaeda's top man in Spain. Mohammed Atta visited Spain not long before he led the September 11th attacks in America. Mr Zougam and Mr Dahdah may have liaised with other extremists across Europe, and with a group believed by the Moroccan security services to have sent the suicide bombers who struck Casablanca last May. There are whisperings of a connection to Ansar al-Islam, an outfit once based in northern Iraq, and also to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian accused of orchestrating the carnage in Baghdad and Karbala earlier this month.

Yet to talk of al-Qaeda responsibility risks misunderstanding the methods that Mr bin Laden's movement has adopted since losing its Afghan sanctuary in 2001. According to American counter-terrorism officials, nearly 3,500 suspected al-Qaeda sympathisers have been detained, in over 100 countries, since September 11th (though some have later been released). Two-thirds of al-Qaeda's known senior leadership has been incapacitated, the Americans claim. Mr bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, his right-hand man, may now be principally preoccupied with saving their own skins. 

Given these disruptions, the threat now comes from what George Tenet, head of the CIA, recently termed a loose collection of regional networks that operate more autonomously and a global movement infected by al-Qaeda's radical agenda. Tens of thousands of graduates from al-Qaeda's Afghan camps have dispersed around the world, taking with them both an apocalyptic philosophy and a deadly expertise. Some may have drawn advice, cash or personnel from Mr bin Laden's inner circle, or from each other; some may take cues from his taped exhortations. But a few may derive nothing more than inspiration from him. Even Mr bin Laden's death or capture is unlikely to defang these disciples. (Intelligence sources are sceptical about claims of co-operation between such terrorists and secular ones such as ETA, even if their use of the same suppliers superficially points to just such a link in Spain.)

By its nature, such a diffuse movement is much harder to monitor than a unitary organisation: witness the apparent lack of any advance intelligence about the Madrid plot. It is also unpredictable in its tactics. Mr bin Laden's cadre has shown considerable flexibility, variously deploying planes, trucks and boats as weapons. But suicide has been a consistent method. Yet the Madrid bombers appear to have eschewed it, though the simultaneity and wantonly indiscriminate lethality of the attacks were familiar. A jihadi website that discussed ways of dislodging the Spanish from Iraq mentioned the elections. The timing of the strike, just before the poll, may also signal a new tactic. 

Where might this hydra bite next? Perhaps because of limited resources, perhaps because of target-hardening in rich countries, the terrorists have since September 11th hit mainly soft targets, such as tourist and religious sites, often in poorer (and Muslim) countries. They have forgone the symbolism of assailing embassies, ships and skyscrapers, but killed infidels where possible, murdering German tourists in Tunisia, French engineers in Pakistan and Australians in Bali. They have also turned on Saudi Arabiaat the behest, the Saudis believe, of Mr bin Laden himself. Madrid was, however, the first Islamist spectacular in western Europe. 

One theory is that Spain became a target after it cracked down on militants whom it had previously tolerated. Something similar may be brewing in Britain, historically a haven for Islamists (especially in what is derisively known as Londonistan). Like Spain, Britain has been excoriated by Mr bin Laden, and it has troops in Iraq. British interests have been targeted in Istanbul; but it has not yet been hit directly. British politicians and police see that exemption as temporary: gloomy warnings were issued this week. 

On the other hand, Mr bin Laden and his ilk bear ancient as well as contemporary grudges. Mr al-Zawahiri calls the Spanish reconquest of Granada in 1492 the tragedy of al-Andalus. Other countries with no involvement in Iraq could be imperilled. As Mr Tenet says, future strikes may involve aircraft, or poisons and chemicals; Mr bin Laden sees the acquisition of nuclear weapons as a religious duty. Shipping is another risk. In 2002, Morocco arrested a gang thought to be planning to attack NATO ships in the straits of Gibraltar.

European officials are considering if there is anything more they can do to avert such catastrophes. Airport-type security checks on some trains are likely, as are more random checks of baggage and cars, and the removal of litter bins that might serve as bomb receptaclesthe sort of grinding measures Britain adopted during the IRA peril. That, plus a continent-wide crossing of fingers.
