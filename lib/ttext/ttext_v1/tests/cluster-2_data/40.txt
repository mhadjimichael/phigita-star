Are official statistics exaggerating America's growth?
 
 
 

 
DESPITE the welcome leap in American employment in March (see
article), America's job market has been surprisingly weak in the past
couple of yearserica's GDP figures, which have been strong, may be
inaccurate, and may be exaggerating the extent of economic growth.

In the two years to the fourth quarter of 2003 America's real GDP grew
at an annual rate of 3.6%. Going by past recoveries, this should have
meant a rise in employment of 2% a year. Instead, non-farm payrolls
have fallen. Most economists say that this reflects a sharp increase
in productivity growth. Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, is
not so sure. Other economies that have enjoyed rapid productivity
gains in recent years, such as Canada and Australia, have also seen
strong increases in employment. 

Nor does Mr Hatzius accept the argument that the employment figures
have been understating job creation. It is too soon to tell whether
March's data (which were published after his study) mark the start of
a delayed catching-up. This leads Mr Hatzius to suggest that GDP is
being overstated. The standard measure of GDP is calculated by totting
up aggregate expenditure; but another estimate, found by summing
incomesstatisticians be overstating America's GDPnancial bubble in
history.
