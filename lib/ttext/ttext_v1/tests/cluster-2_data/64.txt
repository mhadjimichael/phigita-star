The beautiful business
 
FROM Fred Perry to Tiger Woods, star endorsements have boosted the
sales of sports goods. Now David Beckham, captain of the England
football team, has unveiled his new linekham's valuable feet.

Beckham-branded kit looks sure to sell. The pin-up footballer's image
is inescapable (even in soccer-shy America). His club, Real Madrid,
has sold over 1m shirts with Mr Beckham's name and number, 23. These
account for 50% of the team's replica-shirt sales, and have already
recouped much of the #24.5m Real paid Manchester United for Mr
Beckham's signature last June.

It is said that Mr Beckham chose the number 23 because he idolised
Michael Jordan, who had worn it for the Chicago Bulls basketball
team. (His first choice was 7, the number he had had at Manchester
United, but another Real favourite already had it.) Idolised his
sporting ability, or his business acumen? Mr Jordan too has his own logo
