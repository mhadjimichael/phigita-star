.Oo Sally - A Tool for Embedding Strings in Vector Spaces
    Copyright (C) 2010-2011 Konrad Rieck (konrad@mlsec.org)

Introduction
-- 
  Sally is a small tool for mapping a set of strings to a set of vectors.
  This mapping is referred to as embedding and allows for applying
  techniques of machine learning and data mining for analysis of string
  data.  Sally can applied to several types of string data, such as text
  documents, DNA sequences or log files, where it can handle common formats
  such as directories, archives and text files of string data.

  Sally implements a standard technique for mapping strings to a vector
  space that is often referred to as vector space model or bag-of-words
  model.  The strings are characterized by a set of features, where each
  feature is associated with one dimension of the vector space.  The
  following types of features are supported by Sally: bytes, words, n-grams
  of bytes and n-grams of words.

  Sally proceeds by counting the occurrences of the specified features in
  each string and generating a sparse vector of count values. 
  Alternatively, binary or TF-IDF values can be computed and stored in the
  vectors.  Sally then normalizes the vector, for example using the L1 or L2
  norm, and outputs it in a specified format, such as plain text or in
  LibSVM or Matlab format.

  Consult the manual page of Sally for more information.

Dependencies
--
  >= libconfig-1.4
  >= libarchive-2.70

Compilation & Installation
--
  $ ./configure [options]
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install

  --prefix=PATH           Set directory prefix for installation

  By default Sally is installed into /usr/local. If you prefer a
  different location, use this option to select an installation
  directory.

  --enable-libarchive     Enable support for loading archives
     
  If this feature is enabled, Sally can also be applied to read the
  contents of archives, such as .tgz and .zip.  This allows for
  processing string data in compressed form and may drastically save
  storage space.

  --enable-openmp         Enable support for OpenMP (experimental)
    
  This feature enables support for OpenMP in Sally. It is still
  experimental.  Sally will execute certain parts of the processing in
  parallel making use of multi-core architectures where possible.
 
  --enable-md5hash        Enable MD5 as alternative hash

  Sally uses a hash function for mapping different features to
  different dimensions in the vector space.  By default the very
  efficient Murmur hash is used for this task.  In certain critical
  cases it may be useful to use a cryptographical hash as MD5.
