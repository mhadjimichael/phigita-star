Once you have boilerpipe on your classpath, extracting the "main" content from a Web page is really simple:

   URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com/some-location/index.html");
   // NOTE: Use ArticleExtractor unless DefaultExtractor gives better results for you
   String text = ArticleExtractor.INSTANCE.getText(url);

Please also have a look at the demo classes.

Even though there is a DefaultExtractor which should work somehow well on any type of content, there are other extractors that may be more suitable for particular content scenarios. For example, ArticleExtractor adds some heuristics to extract the main content from a news page (this the usual scenario for boilerplate removal, so use this unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing). There is also NumWordsRulesExtractor which resembles the number-of-words-based decision tree presented in the WSDM 2010 Paper (Algorithm 2).

There are also other ways to call the Extractor (using Reader, InputSource, String etc.).

See the API Javadocs for details.
