JAKOB'S NER PACKAGE v0.1
-------------------

This is a rudimentary package of my code that enables the user to extract person, location, organization, and "miscellaneous" named enitities from a text file.

INSTALLATION

Sorry for not providing a simple installation script. You have to compile each part separately. The parts are:

SCRIPTS
-------
make sure your perl/sh paths are compatible with the ones I use in the scripts.

FEX: feature extraction
-----------------------
go to NEpackage/fex/ and run gmake. If there are any problems, try to consult the user manual which can be found at l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/cc-software.html.

SNOW: the classifer
-------------------
go to NEpackage/Snow_v3.0/ and run gmake. if there are any problems, try to consult the user manual which can be found at l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/cc-software.html.

HMMPure: the inference
----------------------
go to NEpackage/cscl/ and run makeit.sh in order to build HMMPure.



USAGE

Once all the parts above succesfully compiled, you should use NEpackage/NEClassifier.pl to do the tagging.
An example file is supplied. It contains a simple sentence. You have to supply this filename as an argument to the script. The output is sent to stdout.
This is an example output:

	[metzler1@frosty NEpackage]$ more example_input.txt 
	John Doe is American,  lives in Champaign and works for the CIA.
	
	[metzler1@frosty NEpackage]$ ./NEClassifier.pl example_input.txt 
	[PER John Doe ] is [MISC American ] , lives in [LOC Champaign ] and works for the [ORG CIA ] . 
	[metzler1@frosty NEpackage]$ 


It is important to note that this package should be used in batch mode, since the overhead of loading the files is ca. 20-30 seconds. Classifying just one sentence as done above will result in 99% overhead.


if you have any problems with this, ask me at metzler1@uiuce.du
Have fun!
