China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of 
talks across the Taiwian Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice 
President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing. Speaking only hours after
Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with 
Taiwan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofong told Reuters: "The necessary 
atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan 
authorities." State media quoted China's top negotiator with Taipei, Tang 
Shubei, as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time 
for the rivals to hold political talks.
