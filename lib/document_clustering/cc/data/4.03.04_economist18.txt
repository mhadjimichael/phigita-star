Lien Chan: not waving but drowning

CHEERINGLY for Taiwan, the political storm surrounding President Chen
Shui-bian's re-election by a thin majority appears to be
subsiding. Even China, which despises Mr Chen, may well be relieved
that Taiwan has not sunk into chaos; a condition which, as it reminded
the island threateningly last week, might force it to intervene. But
unless China's leaders begin to think more imaginatively about ways to
accommodate Taiwan's aspirations, the Taiwan Strait will become an
increasingly unpredictable flashpoint. There is little sign that China
gets the point. 

On March 28th, a few hundred supporters of the defeated presidential
candidate, Lien Chan, and his running mate, James Soong, were moved by
police from the broad avenue in front of the presidential palace in
Taipei. This brought a peaceful end to a week of demonstrations in the
area, which at their peak attracted hundreds of thousands of
people. The protesters were calling for a fresh election, accusing Mr
Chen of unfair tactics, especially of complicity in an allegedly fake
attempt to assassinate him the day before the March 20th polls. They
said the incident was contrived to attract sympathy votes.

Mr Chen has helped to ease the crisis by agreeing to a recount, which
could occur in the next few days. He also allowed American
investigators, invited by the opposition, to examine evidence relating
to the shooting incident, including his wounded abdomen.

This week the American specialists said the evidence they had seen
suggested that Mr Chen and his vice-president, Annette Lu, had indeed
been shotview with the Washington Post this week, Mr Chen said
Taiwanese people could not accept the mainland' s principle and that
if China insisted on Taiwan's acceptance of it, talks would b e. He
said he would proceed with plans to introduce a new constitution in
2006 that would be enacted two years later. China fears the new
constitution would make it more explicit that Taiwan is an independent
country rather than a Chinese province. Mr Chen denied attempting to
change the status quo. But he and China have very different views of
what the status quo is. 

Chinese officials know they have little chance of persuading Taiwan to
accept any kind of political union. Their main aim is to deter a
formal declaration of independence. But the island's fledgling
democracy is fostering growth of what Mr Chen called  a among the
public. Most politicians on the island now try to emphasise their
Taiwaneseness. China, by trying to constrain this tendency, is only
accelerating it. This week, in a move apparently timed to embarrass
the re-elected Mr Chen, China announced the establishment of
diplomatic ties with Taiwan's tiny friend Dominica. This leaves only
26 countries that recognise Taiwan. 

Less helpfully still, China is flexing its muscles in Hong Kong, even
though the territory is supposed to be a model for eventual
reunification with Taiwan. On April 2nd, senior members of China's
parliament were to start a five-day meeting in Beijing t o what the
Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution, has to say on
political reform in the territory. Their ruling is expected to clarify
that Hong Kong cannot have more democracy without China's
permission. And Taiwan's recent political tensions are hardly likely
to make China better disposed towards the merits of democracy. 

Privately, some scholars in Beijing with links to the government say a
more sensible course for China would be to move gradually towards
recognition of the Republic of China, as Taiwan still officially calls
itself, and most importantly allow other countries to do so as
well. They argue that this might at least help reinforce identity in
Taiwan with the name China' and curb the demands of some Taiwanese
radicals for a change of name to the Republic of Taiwan. Sadly for
Taiwan and the region's stability, such creative thinking is still a
heresy in China.
