Padres to the rescue

How a baseball team can revive a city

 Wise words from San Diego's Republican mayor, Dick Murphy, explaining
 how the opening in 1985 of Horton Plaza, a seven-storey shopping
 complex, revitalised a decaying city centre. Clearly, no sane San
 Diegan, then or now, would want the vast, unfocused urban sprawl,
 congested freeways and polluted air that their neighbours some 120
 miles to the north have to suffer. Just as Canada is proud to b e, so
 San Diego, with its green Balboa Park and sparkling yacht marinas,
 boasts of bein g.

Yet the boast is beginning to ring a little hollow. In the 1990s San
Diego's population increased by 18%, but the capacity of its freeways
and expressways rose by only 9%. At the same time, house prices have
been rising too: the average is now about $380,000 ($490,000 for new
homes), which only a fifth of San Diego families can afford to
pay. Moreover, the situation could well worsen: official forecasts
reckon that the population of San Diego county, now almost 3m, will
grow to 3.6m by 2020, putting LA-type strains on local transport and
housing. Indeed, the snail-pace rush-hour on the area's freeways is
already uncomfortably similar to LA's. 

Such problems, of course, are the by-products of success. San Diego's
low point was at the start of the 1990s, when the collapse o f spelled
disaster for the defence contractors clustered around its naval base,
the biggest on the west coast. A decade later, when northern
California was hurt by the bursting of the dotcom bubble, San Diego by
contrast was prospering: its economy was nicely balanced, and skilled
jobs were easy to find in biotechnology or electronics. 

The challenge is to stop the success being self-destructive. The
bigger the demand for housing, the greater the need for higher
wagespecially start-ups, will either founder or leave the
region. Garry Bonelli, spokesman of the San Diego Association of
Governments, points out that San Diego's housing is almost as
expensive as San Francisco's and more expensive than New York's, but
its salaries are lower. That is why David Hale, the president of
CancerVax, a biotech start-up developing drugs to combat cancers,
chose to set up his research centre some 30 miles north of downtown
San Diego: Carlsbad, he says, is a town where his scientists can
afford to find housing with the salaries he can afford to pay
them. Multiply Mr Hale's experience by that of many others, and the
result is urban sprawl. The rich go to exquisite seaside spots such as
La Jolla and Solana Beach; the less rich go to places like Carlsbad;
and the poor, as in so many American cities, are stranded downtown. 

Hence the need for a new version of Horton Plaza to get the downtown
heart beating faster. Mr Murphy's taxpayers and John Moores, the
billionaire owner of the San Diego Padres, the local baseball team,
are betting that a brand new stadium, PETCO Park, will do the
trick. They could well be right. When the stadium, 70% owned by the
city, opened on March 11th for its first game, 40,106 of the 42,000
seats were filledes not turn into a yuppie ghetto. Moreover, Mr Moores
had to guarantee that the city's tax-take from the hotels would be
enough to pay off the bonds it had issued to pay for its share of the
ballpark. In other words, Mr Moores and his Padres take all the risk
and the city gets most of the reward, including full ownership of the
ballpark in 30 years' time.

Not surprisingly, therefore, Mr Moores still seethes at the way legal
challenges delayed the project by two years, with the loss of $52m in
projected ballpark and hotel revenue. Another gripe is the difficulty
of coping with local and state laws (witness the need to preserve and
move a 1924 candy factory, described by Mr Moores a s). Indeed,
according to Mr Moores, he will never get his money back. On the other
hand, he loves his Padres. If they beat the San Francisco Giants in
the three-game series beginning on April 8th, the first home games of
the regular season, he will think his money well spent and so will San Diego.
