A symbol—but of what?

In Europe, Ingrid Betancourt's captivity is seen as an indictment of Colombia's government. To Colombians, she is just one of many victims of a conflict that their president (see article) reckons he's winning

MARELBY AGATTÓN, who runs Colombia's Green Oxygen political movement, occupies a lonely cubicle in Bogotá surrounded by posters demanding the freeing of Ingrid Betancourt, the movement's kidnapped former presidential candidate. All of the posters are in French. In the local elections last October, Green Oxygen did poorly, electing only one mayor and ten councillors, although other leftish movements did well. Ms Agattón bemoans a lack of cash: Colombians haven't given a peso, so the movement relies on foreign donations.

Since her kidnap two years ago by the FARC guerrillas, Ms Betancourt has achieved mythical status in several European countries. There she is seen as a crusader for social justice against a corrupt and murderous political establishment—a Colombian Joan of Arc. In France, hundreds of town councils have adopted her as a “citizen of honour”, as have others in Belgium and half a dozen further countries. That is tribute to a superbly organised campaign, led by Juan Carlos Lecompte, Ms Betancourt's current husband, an advertising executive. It is also because of Ms Betancourt's prior links to France. Her first marriage was to a French diplomat (she has dual nationality). Dominique de Villepin, France's foreign minister, is a friend and former tutor. Her book (“Until Death do us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia”) is a bestseller in France. 

Neither her book, nor her party, nor her crusade stirs Colombians in the same way. They see her not as a cause celèbre, but as a failed, minor politician, and only one among hundreds of kidnap victims being held by the FARC. The special attention she receives abroad provokes irritation. When María Jimena Duzán, a journalist, criticised Ms Betancourt's “deification” in a recent column in El Tiempo, Colombia's main daily, she received 400 e-mails, 70% of them in support. Ms Betancourt's book sold poorly in Colombia, wrote Ms Duzán, because it is “all lies” that make its author look good at the expense of Colombians. Far from being the country's only honest politician, she is herself a child of the establishment. She was never very radical, nor did she fight for the environment or against globalisation, as her supporters claim, wrote Ms Duzán. 

Last year, Mr de Villepin organised a rescue attempt, sending a French plane and secret-service agents to the Brazilian jungle. He failed to tell either Brazil or Colombia. Now, Ms Betancourt's celebrity status has added to pressure on President Álvaro Uribe to negotiate a “humanitarian exchange” with the FARC. 

In all, the FARC are thought to hold several hundred hostages, most of whom it tries to ransom. But they include 20 Colombian politicians, 37 policemen and soldiers and three Americans, captured when their drug-spraying plane was shot down last year. The FARC wants to swap some or all of these for some 300 of its members (including several mid-level commanders) who have been imprisoned.

Ms Betancourt's supporters want Mr Uribe to agree. So do some powerful Colombian political figures, such as Alfonso López, a former president, who is a friend of Ms Betancourt's mother. So, too, does the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based lobby-group; in a report this month, it naively suggests that this could lay the ground for peace talks with the FARC. 

In three years of talks under Mr Uribe's predecessor, the FARC showed no interest in peace or democracy. The government sees a prisoner swap as an invitation to further kidnaps, and as strengthening the FARC while granting it political recognition it does not deserve. Most Colombians agree: 61% oppose a “humanitarian accord”. So Mr Uribe has fixed two conditions: that the FARC release all its kidnap victims, and guarantee that its released prisoners do not return to the ranks. France offered to accept the released guerrillas. Unsurprisingly, the FARC refused this.

The fight over a “humanitarian accord” has become bitter and personal. Mr Lecompte this month left Colombia, saying that he had received death threats which he blamed on supporters of Mr Uribe. 

The campaign for Ms Betancourt's release shows how little understanding her foreign supporters have of Colombia's conflicts. But its subject is an innocent woman who is monstrously confined, as are her fellow hostages. Her supporters should be deluging the FARC with demands for their unconditional release. Past prisoner swaps in Colombia have merely prolonged the country's agony. The hard truth is that there will be no peace in Colombia until the FARC is persuaded that it cannot take power by military means.
