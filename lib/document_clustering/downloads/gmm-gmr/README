# GMM regression   #
####################

To test the program, just do a 'make', then run the 'main_test' executable, 
which performs an EM learning to find the GMM parameters, and then do a 
regression on the data stored in data/test*.csv. 

The resulting parameters are stored in files *.dat and *.gmm that can then 
be plotted in Matlab/Octave using the plotall.m script in the 'matlab_src' 
folder.
