	autoconf/make/.cvsignore, autoconf/make/unreal.mk,
	autoconf/scripts/makemake.sh:

	Changed build process to use .mk instead of .mk~ extension for

	* src/db/btree.c:

	Added optimisation function for the btree backend.

2005-05-10 21:01  ivarch

	* doc/quickref.1.in, src/main/options.c, src/spam/prune.c,
	src/spam/train.c:

	Tweaked the pruning algorithm so it chooses the tokens to be
	discarded more sensibly (and fixed the new pruning algorithm to
	obey the "max tokens to prune" setting), and added a MAXROUNDS
	parameter to -B and -T.

2005-05-09 09:39  ivarch

	* doc/quickref.1.in, src/main/main.c:

	Changed per-user database weighting to 10x instead of 100x, as 100x
	seems to be causing problems.

2005-05-08 22:42  ivarch

	* src/message/parse.c:

	RATS lint

2005-05-08 19:30  ivarch

	* doc/: NEWS, VERSION, lsm.in, spec.in:

	Version bump ready for 1.1.0

2005-05-08 19:13  ivarch

	* doc/NEWS, doc/TODO, doc/quickref.1.in, src/include/options.h,
	src/main/main.c, src/main/options.c, src/spam/allowlist.c,
	src/spam/db.c, src/spam/merge.c, src/spam/spami.h,
	src/spam/token.c:

	Added weighting to databases, set to 100 for per-user / -d
	databases, 1 for global, 2 for first global if two globals are
	defined.

2005-05-08 14:48  ivarch

	* doc/NEWS, doc/TODO, doc/quickref.1.in, src/tests/html.c,
	src/tests/main.c:

	Added new test for FONT tags in HTML; originally was going to look
	for tiny text (FONT SIZE=1) but that gives worse performance in the
	benchmarking than just looking for FONT.

2005-05-06 15:00  ivarch

	* doc/NEWS, doc/TODO, doc/quickref.1.in, src/tests/html.c,
	src/tests/main.c:

	Replaced the IMG test with the EXTERNAL-IMG test, since this gives
	better benchmark results - presumably <img> tags in normal HTML
	mail are quite common, but <img> tags referring to external
	(non-embedded) images are more likely to appear in spam. For some
	reason leaving both IMG and EXTERNAL-IMG in drops the benchmark
	performance.

2005-05-06 14:07  ivarch

	* doc/NEWS, src/tests/html.c:

	Made test for IMG tags case-insensitive.

2005-05-06 13:31  ivarch

	* doc/NEWS, doc/TODO, doc/quickref.1.in, src/tests/gibberish.c,
	src/tests/main.c:

	Added GIBBERISH-LONGWORDS filter - add tokens for any words 30-60
	characters in length that start with a letter.

2005-05-06 12:45  ivarch

	* doc/TODO:

	Removed "optimise attachment scanning" TODO since profiler says it
	takes up 0.06% of run-time; not a priority.

2005-05-06 11:29  ivarch

	* src/: include/message.h, message/alloc.c, message/parse.c,
	tests/gibberish.c:

	Optimised the gibberish checks by building up a list of word
	positions when the message is parsed, instead of repeatedly
	scanning through for each gibberish check.

2005-05-04 14:43  ivarch

	* README:

	Added note about MySQL 4.1.x performance improvement

2005-05-04 14:42  ivarch

	* doc/quickref.1.in:

	Reworded pruning note to take account of new pruning rules

2005-05-03 00:05  ivarch

	* doc/TODO, src/db/btree.c, src/spam/prune.c:

	Fixed bug in btree backend causing -B to give a different training
	pattern to GDBM etc: pruning was causing corruption due to a
	mistake in the "mark block as free" code.

2005-05-01 15:35  ivarch

	* doc/TODO:

	There is a bug in the btree backend, it seems, since running -B
	with GDBM/SQLite/MySQL gives a slightly different training pattern
	to running with the btree backend; the end result is that the btree
	backend gives a less accurate filter. This needs fixing; adding to
	TODO.

2005-05-01 13:08  ivarch

	* src/db/sqlite.c:

	Fixed bug triggered in sqlite due to not finalising a query run
	(during pruning).

2005-04-30 21:17  ivarch

	* doc/TODO:

	Removed "independent databases" TODO, since this is not required -
	the code seems to suggest that pruning will be fine with token
	aging and multiple databases, as the update count is read from the
	writable database (the one being pruned), and that is the only time
	it is used.

2005-04-30 19:14  ivarch

	* test/t08-dbprune2:

	Further fix to obsolete test, so it works in "make memtest".

2005-04-30 18:55  ivarch

	* test/t08-dbprune2:

	Fixed obsolete pruning test so it skips on anything but the old
	binary tree backend.

2005-04-30 18:46  ivarch

	* src/spam/: prune.c, update.c:

	Fix so we just display pruning information when we are supposed to,
	not every update.

2005-04-30 18:12  ivarch

	* doc/NEWS, doc/TODO, doc/VERSION, doc/lsm.in, doc/spec.in,
	src/spam/prune.c, src/spam/token.c, src/spam/update.c:

	Added new pruning algorithm which takes token age into account;
	should fall back to the old pruning method if the last update
	counter is not available. Also changed the token probability
	calculation to just use the raw spam/nonspam counts for each token
	instead of scaling with the global message counts; this means that
	database pruning will not need to modify the message counts, and in
	fact for new style databases the global message counts are no
	longer necessary.

2005-04-29 14:40  ivarch

	* autoconf/make/unreal.mk:

	Added new Makefile target for doc/changelog, for release manager
	use

2005-04-29 14:38  ivarch

	* doc/release-checklist:

	Release checklist updated to reflect existence of Debian package
	maintainer

2005-04-21 12:57  ivarch

	* debian/changelog, doc/NEWS, doc/TODO, doc/VERSION, doc/lsm.in,
	doc/quickref.1.in, doc/spec.in, src/tests/gibberish.c,
	src/tests/main.c:

	Added gibberish "badstart" and "hyphens" tests (sponsored by
	SpamDefy, http://www.spamdefy.com/).

2005-03-08 15:13  ivarch

	* debian/rules:

	Removed problematic "make distclean" from debian/rules

2005-03-06 12:21  ivarch

	* autoconf/configure.in:

	Fix for MySQL detection on systems that wrongly cache lib lookups

2005-03-05 17:27  ivarch

	* autoconf/make/unreal.mk, debian/changelog, doc/NEWS, doc/TODO,
	doc/VERSION, src/db/mysql.c, src/main/main.c, test/t01-dbcreate,
	test/t12-benchmark:

	Allow MySQL testing if MYSQLDB env var passed to "make test" et al;
	also, attempt to autocreate MySQL database if it does not exist,
	warn otherwise.

2005-03-05 15:25  ivarch

	* src/db/obtree.c:

	Only complain to user about obtree if they did not specify it
	explicitly

2005-03-05 14:51  ivarch

	* autoconf/configure.in, autoconf/header.in, debian/changelog,
	doc/NEWS, doc/TODO, doc/VERSION, doc/lsm.in, doc/quickref.1.in,
	doc/spec.in, src/db/btree.c, src/db/main.c, src/db/mysql.c,

	src/spam/prune.c, src/spam/spami.h, src/spam/token.c,
	src/spam/update.c:

	Added third parameter for each token, a "last updated" counter;
	added "obtree" backend for old-format backend that does not have
	this third parameter, and we now warn verbosely if that obtree
	backend is used.

2005-03-04 19:08  ivarch

	* src/: db/sqlite.c, main/main.c:

	Fixed SQLite write access bug that claimed open succeeded when
	write access was not actually possible

2005-03-04 18:53  ivarch

	* src/: include/log.h, main/log.c, main/main.c:

	More logging information; output logs even if not adding message
	headers, but output them to stderr in that case

2005-03-04 18:36  ivarch

	* autoconf/make/unreal.mk, doc/NEWS, doc/VERSION, doc/spec.in:

	RPM build update to allow "--with static" for a new "qsf-static"
	RPM

2005-03-04 12:09  ivarch

2004-06-22 22:54  ivarch

	* doc/NEWS, doc/VERSION, doc/quickref.1.in, doc/spec.in,
	src/include/message.h, src/include/options.h, src/main/help.c,
