Hi All,

Great post idea.  My top 3 based on my research for Visible Ops Private Cloud and Client4Cloud: Desktop Transformation for Universal Clients (http://tinyurl.com/ccxbskt) are:

1) Licensing as a Service - managing license across Enterprise to Various Cloud providers.  This is an emerging space but has quite a bit of buzz around it.  Virtual Desktops beyond the singular private cloud (versus multiple private to private or private to public) will not be feasible without it.

2) User Virtualization AKA User Environment Management - fueled by Desktop Transformation to Universal Clients which covers the solution Ravi mentions around Business Continuity and Recovery below.  Essentially the shift from machine to user approach will enable gaining control over consumerization of IT by managing the applications and data based on the user not virtual machine.  This will help reduce risks for IP/Data leakage while enabling Bring Your Own Device scenarios.  This is objectively covered in my book Client4Cloud (launching next week at Upcon) based on feedback from top User Virtualization Products (AppSense and Liquidware Labs) and key industry luminaries including David Greschler (founder Softgrid AKA App-V), Simon Crosby (founder XenSource - Former Citrix CTO), and several customers, analysts, consultants, etc.

3) DevOps - automating the Development Process (not just for Enterprise but also ISV) through true integrated workflows, visibility and integration to backend systems for Change Control and Asset tracking to reduce malware threats.  Will solve a big issues around manual processes for installation and setup slowing down the "self service" nature of cloud computing (private or public).

Again - great posts.  There is quite a bit coming in this area and the shift from Client to Cloud is heating up.

Cheers,
Jeanne

Hi all,
I was also thinking from long time that solution like desktop recovery( with includes Business continuty and vertual desktop), having a cloud instance that can be restored if hardware fails and a payed solution to open that desktop from other clients. Business case would be to work remote option with a tablet or a desktop computer and can move without carrying 4kg laptop bag.

Share your Top Three Cloud Solution category ideas for business?  I
know the answers will depend on circumstances a lot.


However, I think that the growth of the cloud market, like most new
technology, depends a lot on people beyond the bleeding edge getting
comfortable with this kind of computing. People get comfortable pretty

fast when they actually experience the benefits for the themselves.
Often managers that were once afraid of turning some technology on
soon become fearful of having it turned off. Easy, safe and sure
solutions can be the most important entry points for opening the door

to the Cloud for more and more businesses.

My Top Three Cloud Wins from successful experiences in terms of post
implementation benefits from the customer perspective are:

1) Virtual Desktops - There are so many versions of Virtual Desktop

Infrastructures now that there is one to fit almost every need.
Selecting the right one seems the bigger challenge now. It is rare for
me to find a device based desktop deployment that makes much sense
anymore.

2) Business Continuity for Compliance (Duplicate Infrastructure for
Contingency Recovery) - Most CR systems get turned on to test and then
shut down forever. Cloud Resources have been a superb fit, especially
for compliance mandated situations. The cost/performance can't be

beat.
3) Externalizing Resources for Prototyping and Development - Not
having to procure and manage hardware, being able to expand and
contract capacity at will, jump starting innovation cost effectively,
being able to validate ideas on the cheap, etc. are all good reasons

why this has been so successful.

What would your three be?

Jeff
