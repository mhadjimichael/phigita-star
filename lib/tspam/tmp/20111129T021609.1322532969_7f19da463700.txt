Around 2004-2007, I worked on the public-facing Sun Grid (1$ a cpu hour). I don't think the business model was lacking, rather what seemed to be missing was more in line with what we call PaaS and SaaS. We kind of nibbled at some SaaS aspects of public grid computing, but not anywhere near what cloud brought. I would say what was missing was sufficiently compelling and properly marketed solutions/products that customers could just run (SaaS like)..

As far as furthering cloud adoption -- I think cloud adopters are looking backward at your question and saying something like: "Done deal".

As far as big mistakes for "cloud marketers", I think two notable ones are (1) hyping anything as being cloud, when it doesn't meet the NIST definition; and (2) making absurd claims about security or privacy protection -- I'm not saying that no one has high-trust-worthy offerings, just that many seem to blatantly exaggerate what little they might do...

To be clear, I am an advocate of both public and especially private cloud models for IT. I think the average consumer of cloud services will be able to achieve more "professional grade" security --if you carefully evaluate your vendors-- and more cost-effectively than they can possibly afford to implement on a per-system basis or in-house in a small to medium enterprise. All this comes at the risk of your provider deciding to change some aspect of what they do that you are depending on...
