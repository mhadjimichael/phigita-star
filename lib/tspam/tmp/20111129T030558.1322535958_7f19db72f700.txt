If I'm recalling correctly, only Solaris was supported, or maybe Solaris
and one other OS -- I forget what. It was not IaaS, but I would describe it
as closer to PaaS in this sense. I remember talking to someone from Sun at
the time and suggesting that they support Linux, but they had another axe
to grind. And it's always hard to sell two axes at the same time, even if
they're both sharp.
