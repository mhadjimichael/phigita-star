Active Discussion of the week

 * SixFigureTrader.com  EurexDayTrader.com started a discussion on a news article:
  How to treat the losers? (5)

  > If "losers grow by way of distance from the entry" the most naive answer
  > to your question would be: make that distance small ;-))
  > 
  > The fact that you have a relatively small percentage of losers under
  > random entry assumption tells me that you are using large stops (or no
  > stops at all). So most of time you close profitably due to reversion,
  > but eventually, as Dmitrii indicates you give all back (with interests!)
  > in "black swans" with just a few losers. Well actually it would more
  > frequent than one can think. Not only, if capital is relatively small,
  > sooner or later your margins might blow, thus practically creating a
  > time bomb.
  > 
  > On the other hand, i guess that you have already found out that in case
  > you use tight stops (which would be the naive and trivial answer to your
  > question) they would eat you alive, not even allowing you to reach a
  > break even point in the long run.
  > 
  > Especially because "the entry logic is pretty close to random" and,
  > therefore, there is actually no reason why a trade should close
  > favorably with an higher probability, instead of hitting a stop. So you
  > would be "realizing" a lot of negative trades (which added up with
  > spread and commission) would give rise a losing strat.
  > 
  > If you insist keeping almost random the nature of entries, imho, you
  > will have just a few possibilities:
  > 
  > * Use an option game to hedge (both sell and buy appropriately options
  > at different strikes to protect margins and at same time possibly create
  > a steady revenue)
  > 
  > * Create an algorithmic overlay by "superposing" strategies in such a
  > way that each strat provides an hedging action to the other ones, while
  > all strategies may run essentially without stops. (This requires clearly
  > a full algorithmic approach and top minds/top quants for effective
  > implementation.)
  > 
  > * Do both (depending on strategy)
  > 
  > Or you can (partially) give up on your "random" entry appoach and make
  > slighly easier the trade management part.
  > 
  > Tom
