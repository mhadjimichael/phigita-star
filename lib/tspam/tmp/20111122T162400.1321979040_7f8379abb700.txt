--------------------------------------
The NBA season may be unusually absent at this time of year, but thankfully  
we can still count on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and oh yes... preparation  
for taxes. Before falling asleep next to a warm fireplace with a belly full  
of savory delicacies and sugary sweets, be sure to log in to your AdSense  
account to double-check your address. To ensure that your AdSense account  
reflects your current tax standing, you may even re-submit your tax  
information. We'll soon be using the information in your AdSense account to  
generate your tax forms for 2011, so you'll want to make sure that the  
information we have is correct.

Remember, you'll only receive a tax form 1099-MISC from us if you meet  
either of the following requirements:


You submitted a Form W-9, are not a corporation, and were paid at least US  
$600 in 2011
You indicated that you are subject to backup withholding and had taxes  
withheld
Enjoy the festivities!
