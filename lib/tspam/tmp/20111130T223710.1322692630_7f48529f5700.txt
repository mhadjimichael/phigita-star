The Secret of the Sencha Class System by Jacky Nguyen
The Sencha Class System was first introduced in Ext JS 4.0 and was a major step forward in making it easy to build object oriented JavaScript code. As a core part of the Sencha JavaScript platform, it’s now a shared component between Ext JS and Sencha Touch 2. ( http://www.sencha.com/learn/sencha-class-system/ )


Using Ext GWT 2 & 3 Components at the Same Time by Darrell Meyer
Over the past weeks, we introduced you to some of the new features and improvements in Ext GWT 3. To allow a smooth transition from Ext GWT 2 to 3, Ext GWT lets you include both v2 and v3 components in the same application. This article explains the steps you need to take to run components from both versions at the same time. ( http://www.sencha.com/learn/running-ext-gwt-2-and-3-together/ )


What’s New in Ext JS 4.1 by Don Griffin
The primary focus of the upcoming Ext JS 4.1 is performance. We have been hard at work to improve performance across the board, but we have concentrated on two main areas: rendering and layout. While the majority of our time has been dedicated to this effort, there are many other exciting developments to share. Chief among these are some major improvements to grid and border layout and a preview of the new Neptune theme. ( http://www.sencha.com/blog/whats-new-in-ext-js-4-1/ )


Upgrading to Sencha Touch 2 PR2 by James Pearce
In this article, we'll take a very simple Sencha Touch application, the City Bars guide, and make it run on the PR2 release of the Sencha Touch 2 framework. Along the way, we'll discuss best practices, changes in APIs, and new opportunities. ( http://www.sencha.com/learn/upgrading-to-sencha-touch-2-pr2/ )
