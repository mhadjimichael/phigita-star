--------------------------------------
This is the first post in our two-part AdSense Crawler Errors series.

There are many ways that publishers can go about optimizing their site for  
AdSense; opting-in to text/image ads, upgrading to our preferred ad  
formats, and increasing ad coverage across a site are just a few of the  
more well-known ones. But did you know that there's another straightforward  
optimization tip that many publishers often overlook?

A bit of context
Your site's robots.txt file essentially acts as a gatekeeper that  
determines which web crawlers, web robots, and search engines have access  
to your site and which do not. Those that are granted permission can do  
things like view your pages and index your site. Those that don't have  
permission are not able to view or index specific sections of your site,  
depending on what you've specified.

AdSense ads are displayed through the use of an AdSense web crawler. That  
crawler scans your page's content and determines which ads to display,  
according to specific keywords. If our AdSense crawler is being blocked by  
your robots.txt file, we're going to have a difficult time displaying  
relevant ads on your site. As a result, your users may see less relevant  
ads, which can lead to a lower CTR.

How you can help yourself
View the contents of your robots.txt file by going to  
[yourdomain.com]/robots.txt. (If you have a subdomain, it likely has a  
robots.txt file as well, located at [sub.yourdomain.com]/robots.txt.) Be  
sure that the file is configured to allow our AdSense ad crawler to view  
your site. You can do that by simply adding the following two lines to the  
very top of the file:

User-agent: Mediapartners-Google
Disallow:
This will ensure that our AdSense ad crawler can access your site and will  
help display more relevant ads. As a result, you can potentially benefit  
from increased ad revenue. Please note that making this change will not  
impact your Google search rankings. Adding these two lines to your  
robots.txt file will only help to deliver better, more relevant ads to  
pages with AdSense code already on them. Pages that don't have AdSense ad  
code will not be affected.

If you have URLs with any errors, you can see what they are by logging into  
your AdSense account and clicking on 'Account Settings' from the home page.  
 From there, click on 'View errors' under 'Access and Authorization.'


Stay tuned for the second post in our AdSense Crawler Errors series, where  
we'll cover crawler login issues and how you can solve them.
