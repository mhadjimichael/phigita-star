--------------------------------------
Most of enterprise vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle are coming up with
licensing agreements where you can use their products in public cloud like
AWS and mostly it is based on number of core being used and not on the no
of applications.. Also most of these vendors are coming up with SAAS based
licensing model for their products like office 365 , sharePoint online,
Sibel online etc.. .if you talking about fortune 500 players, it is
dominated with private cloud implementations for running core business
critical processes..I think with the Public cloud option now enterprise
software companies have easy way of providing their products for small- mid
size businesses as well...
