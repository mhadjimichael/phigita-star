Your two reasons is why we will see more and more PaaS solutions from the vendors cloud.  Then it is all about the NPV of using it verses the company's internal cloud offering or internal virtualized service.

I agree this applies to SaaS versus buying a license.

But buying a license in the Cloud versus on-premise really makes no difference (to the software vendor in terms of revenue).   And in many cases it means more license revenue.

To date, I've seen two very clear reasons for software vendors lack of support for cloud-friendly licensing:

1)      They are afraid of support - this issue is rapidly declining, but still out there, and many are now taking a "go ahead and do it, but if the cloud is the problem you're on your own";

2)      They have an existing licensing model with VARs that is incompatible with cloud licensing, and this takes lots of time and lawyers.

A great example of this is why we don't see Windows 7 pre-built VMs in the large commercial clouds.  Microsoft's VAR licensing model ties the Windows 7 license to a single, specific CPU - this is entrenched to ensure that one Windows license is used on one "computer".  This also is to avoid the common practice of "you can install on your work and home machine" used by some other software.  It's really explicit, and directly tied to the commercial PC business model.

Clearly tying to a specific CPU doesn't work in any public cloud, as the specific CPU cannot be guaranteed.

While to you and me it seems like an easy change, the ripple effects on the Microsoft reseller chain is potentially huge.  And they need to figure all that out.

But from a revenue perspective, they will likely only make money by offering this - more licenses = more money.  There's lots of incentive for them to allow Windows 7 in the cloud, just as they allow Windows Server in the cloud today.

Anyway, I don't think it's as much conspiracy theory as it is just annoying, historical, legal-ese that needs to get undone without breaking anything else.

I think you're right, Ian, that most packaged software giants are throwing cold water on cloud-based services. But these same companies see the value of offering their own suite of cloud services... Office365 and Azure being the msft example.

IMO, this is to be expected. Sales teams and CFOs must continue to focus their immediate effort on the packaged software cash cow while offering alternative XaaS to hedge their  bet on the future. Deep in the heart of these same companies, they realize the operational efficiencies of XaaS over packaged software to their own business. As with all tech transitions, the largest hurdle to overcome is getting the customer and the sales teams to come to terms with the new pricing/compensation models.

An interesting theme to explore would be the position of the current large IT vendors, the IBMs the MSofts the Oracles. Cloud is a real threat to them.. A typical IT server in one of their customers has an average utilisation of around 5%. Yet the customer pays for 100% of the hardware, software and support. In a cloud service, public or private, you can easily achieve 20%. So you get four times the business function for the same price, or more worryingly for the vendors you can get the same business function for a quarter of their price, crash their revenues and even more so their profits, this 'stuff' still has the very high margins.
So how have they reacted? Most with initial scepticism and throwing on cold water and then later with cloud offerings which did not seem to sell because they weren't realy trying. None have made significant marketing push to promote cloud. Why should Amazon still be the biggest cloud supplier when any one of the large vendors could just swat them with one swipe?

we communicate Cloud Computing? Or, if I put it the other way around,
what are cloud computing marketers biggest mistakes?
