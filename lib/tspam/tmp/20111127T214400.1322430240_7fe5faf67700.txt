Hi all,
I was also thinking from long time that solution like desktop recovery(
with includes Business continuty and vertual desktop), having a cloud
instance that can be restored if hardware fails and a payed solution to
open that desktop from other clients. Business case would be to work remote
option with a tablet or a desktop computer and can move without carrying
4kg laptop bag.
