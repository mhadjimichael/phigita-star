--------------------------------------
Share your Top Three Cloud Solution category ideas for business?  I
know the answers will depend on circumstances a lot.

However, I think that the growth of the cloud market, like most new
technology, depends a lot on people beyond the bleeding edge getting
comfortable with this kind of computing. People get comfortable pretty
fast when they actually experience the benefits for the themselves.
Often managers that were once afraid of turning some technology on
soon become fearful of having it turned off. Easy, safe and sure
solutions can be the most important entry points for opening the door
to the Cloud for more and more businesses.

My Top Three Cloud Wins from successful experiences in terms of post
implementation benefits from the customer perspective are:

1) Virtual Desktops - There are so many versions of Virtual Desktop
Infrastructures now that there is one to fit almost every need.
Selecting the right one seems the bigger challenge now. It is rare for
me to find a device based desktop deployment that makes much sense
anymore.
2) Business Continuity for Compliance (Duplicate Infrastructure for
Contingency Recovery) - Most CR systems get turned on to test and then
shut down forever. Cloud Resources have been a superb fit, especially
for compliance mandated situations. The cost/performance can't be
beat.
3) Externalizing Resources for Prototyping and Development - Not
having to procure and manage hardware, being able to expand and
contract capacity at will, jump starting innovation cost effectively,
being able to validate ideas on the cheap, etc. are all good reasons
why this has been so successful.

What would your three be?

Jeff
