--------------------------------------
The biggest Cloud Computing Marketing Mistake I think I made was one
of strategy. We were really excited about Virtual Desktops via
Terminal Server and Citrix and we pushed them hard. We liked them,
used them and knew they worked better for the right situation. The few
customers that used them from us liked them better and they just made
sense from the perspective of cost, accessibility, etc. At least for a
lot of the 10 - 100 desktop companies we supported. These cloud
desktops might not meet the published definition of cloud, but we
didn't have that at the time. The lesson here is fundamental I think.

Strategically we thought the facts were more than compelling enough
for virtual/cloud desktops and began pushing bids stressing the server
based desktop model when there was a fit and our clients needed to
upgrade their stuff or new clients popped up. The clients/prospects
typically reacted like they thought we were trustworthy experts
somehow selling up the option that would make us less money. They
tended to be very uncomfortable with the whole notion. Tilt!

It is not like they were completely satisfied with the infrastructure
they had at all. If anything, they seemed to cling to familiar misery.
It was the early/mid 2000s and the Cloud meme had not taken hold and
caused the herd to look up. In hindsight, we were trying to do right
by the clients and build the business we really wanted, shifting from
a traditional IT shop to the next generation of computing.

I think if I had to do it over again, I would be more neutral about
viable competing solutions (it's not my money after all and therefore
not my decision to make) while using for our own purposes and those
who wanted it, the server based solution I knew to be "best".  If
customers then asked what we used or how did I get my desktop on one
of their machines, for example, I would show them and explain why we
used it and tell them, very truthfully, you're probably not ready for
this yet. And likely then, there would not much I could do to talk
them out of wanting just what we had. At the least they wouldn't be
playing defense.

We clearly tried to get out ahead of the wave and bring our clients
along, but likely would have done much better to fold in somewhere
behind the leading edge.

I like the question. It is certainly something something I still think
about.
