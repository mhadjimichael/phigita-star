Did you know that there will be a mobile device for every person on earth  
by 2015, and that mobile searches have grown by 4x since 2010 1 ? That  
means that every day more and more of your users are looking for your  
contentâ€¦on mobile devices. What's their experience like? Can they easily  
read what's on the screen without pinching and zooming? Do you have links  
that are difficult to click instead of user-friendly navigation buttons?

61% of users are unlikely to return to a site that isn't mobile friendly  
2 . It's important to remember that even if users can see a website on a  
smartphone, it doesn't necessarily mean that the site is mobile-friendly  
and easy to navigate. Your users are going mobile as we speak, and so the  
most important thing you can do to grow your business using the mobile web  
is to create a mobile-friendly website.

Here are ten tips to help you design a mobile-friendly site:


Keep it quick - Design your site to load fast and make copy easy to scan
Simplify navigation - Create clear navigation and search functionalities
Be thumb-friendly - Design your site so any size hand can easily interact  
with it
Design for visibility - Make it easy for your customers to read
Make it accessible - Mobile sites should work across all mobile devices
Make it easy to convert - Create clear ways for your users to make  
purchases or contact you
Make it local - Consumers look for local info on their phones all the time
Make it seamless - Convert as much of the functionality of your desktop  
site to mobile
Use mobile site redirects - Ensure that visitors who visit your website  
from a mobile device are redirected to your mobile-friendly site
Listen, learn and iterate - Make testing and optimization an ongoing process

To review a detailed set of these best practices, download a copy of the 10  
Mobile Site Best Practices. Visit howtogomo.com to explore actual mobile  
site examples of each best practice and use the GoMoMeter to see how your  
site is faring on mobile*.

Finally, take a look at Google Sites for Mobile Landing Pages*, a free and  
easy-to-use tool that enables you to build mobile pages.
