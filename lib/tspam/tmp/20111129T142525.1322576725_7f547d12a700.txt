--------------------------------------
I have been supporting "sellers" for last 1 year on Cloud Opportunities in Growth Market and learnt a lot on how these stuff are on the ground.Some of my observation.
1) In most of the scenario buyer has only 1 goal, " to have a great RoI" without understanding what can contribute to it. In some cases they have Virtualized environment in test and production and Automation can give a few more points but lots of ease of administration which they feel is not enough. 
 
2) As rightly pointed out by Govind, enterprise products should look at the changing the licensing model. Also Cloud Managers ( VmWare ) changed the model which is based on managed nodes which has its pros and cons.
3) Most of Cloud deals take few quarters to realize and there is not patience from 'sellers" to wait for long.
4) IMHO  Hybrid Cloud model would be successful where the enterprise have a private cloud with few nodes on OSS or basic Cloud Managers and they would like to exploit Public Cloud ( Amazon VPC ) for handling peak load conditions. So it comes down to how to transfer the data secure across the instances, how to monitor instances in Public Cloud and keep the data secured in Public Cloud..


Cloud is more of generating new Business Model and enterprises would have to excite customers with new ideas.

These are great insights about sales issues related to public cloud and managed hosting providers. Similar insights into sales and/or buy-side issues related to private cloud adoption by market segments will be great!
