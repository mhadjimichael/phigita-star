The license is the next step.  But even if there is an private cloud offering many of those companies are using the cloud for application development and Testing before they bring the application source code into their private cloud.

Most of enterprise vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle are coming up with licensing agreements where you can use their products in public cloud like AWS and mostly it is based on number of core being used and not on the no of applications.. Also most of these vendors are coming up with SAAS based licensing model for their products like office 365 , sharePoint online, Sibel online etc.. .if you talking about fortune 500 players, it is dominated with private cloud implementations for running core business critical processes..I think with the Public cloud option now enterprise software companies have easy way of providing their products for small- mid size businesses as well...

A major factor to consider is pricing for the cloud. Most of the
enterprise vendors sell to large enterprises with so called perpetual
license deals worth anywhere from $50,000 to $500,000 per license.
These licenses support between 100 to 500 different applications. When
a business-user (it is always the business user and not the IT
department that initiates the first move), they are looking to
deploying a single application on a pay as you go model.

How does an enterprise software company price their product? Most of
them come up with a formula based on the life of the software (between
4 to 7 years) added a processing margin on top and come up with a
monthly price. But get this: This price is still based on their old
enterprise price supporting 100-500 different applications, not on a
single application! Therefore the ROI model that the business user is
looking for is not there. On top of it, you have Ian's situation of
server/software utilization. It is no wonder that more and more
companies are looking at Open Source software when they go to the
cloud.

If the Oracle's of the world do not pay attention, they are likely to
lose their dominance in a few years. It seems just like yesterday when
I was told, we are a complete Microsoft shop and everyone used MS
Software. Today 30% of the sales team have Macs and quite a few of the
developers and internal IT folks are running Linux. I would estimate
the MSFT adoption has dropped to about 50% in my current organization.
Is this the future for enterprise software vendors?
