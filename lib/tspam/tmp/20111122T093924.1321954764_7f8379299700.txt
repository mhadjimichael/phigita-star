How do I know this is not a fake email?
*************
An email really coming from PayPal will address you by your first and last names or your 
business name. It will not ask you for sensitive information like your password, bank 
account or credit card details. Most fake emails threaten that your account will be 
in jeopardy if you do not take action immediately. An email that urgently requests you 
to supply sensitive personal information is usually an attempt at fraud. Also, fake emails 
often contain misspellings and grammatical errors or are written in a language which you 
did not set as preferred for your PayPal account. Remember not to click any links in 
suspicious looking emails.
