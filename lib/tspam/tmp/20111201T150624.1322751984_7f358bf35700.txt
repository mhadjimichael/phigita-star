Disclaimer:  I have not built a multi-threaded QuickFix-based FIX engine.
I do not know whether QuickFix is architected in a way that would be
consistent with multi-threading.

Assuming that it's possible on the QuickFix side, you might consider
using the the std::thread threading facilities provided by the new c++11
standard.  There are versions of g++ (gcc's c++ compiler) that support
std::thread on both linux and windows.  (I don't happen to know whether
msvc supports std::thread.)  (There are also commercial third-party
std::thread libraries, so that might be an option for your particular
platform.)

If I were going to start a new multi-threaded c++ project today, I would
definitely use std::thread over boost::thread.  std::thread has become
real over the last little while, and is now part of the standard.

Sorry, I have no (FIX-related) code snippets.

Good luck!
