--------------------------------------
An interesting theme to explore would be the position of the current large
IT vendors, the IBMs the MSofts the Oracles. Cloud is a real threat to
them. A typical IT server in one of their customers has an average
utilisation of around 5%. Yet the customer pays for 100% of the hardware,
software and support. In a cloud service, public or private, you can easily
achieve 20%. So you get four times the business function for the same
price, or more worryingly for the vendors you can get the same business
function for a quarter of their price, crash their revenues and even more
so their profits, this 'stuff' still has the very high margins.
So how have they reacted? Most with initial scepticism and throwing on cold
water and then later with cloud offerings which did not seem to sell
because they weren't realy trying. None have made significant marketing
push to promote cloud. Why should Amazon still be the biggest cloud
supplier when any one of the large vendors could just swat them with one
swipe?
