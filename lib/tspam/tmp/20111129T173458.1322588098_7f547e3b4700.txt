I think you're right, Ian, that most packaged software giants are throwing cold water on cloud-based services. But these same companies see the value of offering their own suite of cloud services... Office365 and Azure being the msft example. 

IMO, this is to be expected. Sales teams and CFOs must continue to focus their immediate effort on the packaged software cash cow while offering alternative XaaS to hedge their  bet on the future. Deep in the heart of these same companies, they realize the operational efficiencies of XaaS over packaged software to their own business. As with all tech transitions, the largest hurdle to overcome is getting the customer and the sales teams to come to terms with the new pricing/compensation models.

A typical IT server in one of their customers has an average utilisation of around 5%. Yet the customer pays for 100% of the hardware, software and support. In a cloud service, public or private, you can easily achieve 20%. So you get four times the business function for the same price, or more worryingly for the vendors you can get the same business function for a quarter of their price, crash their revenues and even more so their profits, this 'stuff' still has the very high margins.
> So how have they reacted? Most with initial scepticism and throwing on cold water and then later with cloud offerings which did not seem to sell because they weren't realy trying. None have made significant marketing push to promote cloud. Why should Amazon still be the biggest cloud supplier when any one of the large vendors could just swat them with one swipe?
