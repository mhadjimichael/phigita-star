Freelancers – Let Employers Know They Can Rehire You! 

Freelancers, if you've been feeling the love from an Employer and you want to make it a long-term commitment, let them know that they can rehire you instantly with Guru's new rehiring function.

Starting December 4, with the new My Freelancers page, they can store you in a list where you’ll be hard to miss the next time they need to hire someone.

This rehiring tool will show up in the Employer's My Freelancers page, so point it out to Employers to let them know the next time they want someone to rely on, they can rehire you.

It's simple, it's easy, and it builds up your ratings and workload.

When an Employer rehires you, the project will be immediately awarded to you. All you have to do is say 'yes.'

Coming to Guru on December 4… Freelancers can be Rehired
