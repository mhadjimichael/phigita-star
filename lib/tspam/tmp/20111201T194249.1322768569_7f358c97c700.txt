A New Way To Navigate Guru.com, Coming December 4 

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication and your new navigation is just that. It’s the same Guru system you know and love but with simpler options.

    My Account – This is your launching pad. Get anywhere you need to be in one click.
    Leads – Look up the leads you have and make sure you're checking in to be first for new projects.
    Proposals – Submit proposals for projects in just a few simple steps.
    Projects – Manage the projects Employers have awarded you and keep your Employers up to date.
    Payments – Send invoices and request SafePay fund releases here so you can get paid.
    Search – Browse Guru.com’s project pool and submit proposals.
    Messages – Quick access to your messages from any page so you’ll always be quick to respond.
    Alerts - When the indicator is red, click it to see your newest project alerts.

Along with the new navigation, we welcome a new design to our homepage. 

We're making the navigation easier. On December 4, use it and let us know what you think.
