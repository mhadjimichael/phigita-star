--------------------------------------
A major factor to consider is pricing for the cloud. Most of the
enterprise vendors sell to large enterprises with so called perpetual
license deals worth anywhere from $50,000 to $500,000 per license.
These licenses support between 100 to 500 different applications. When
a business-user (it is always the business user and not the IT
department that initiates the first move), they are looking to
deploying a single application on a pay as you go model.

How does an enterprise software company price their product? Most of
them come up with a formula based on the life of the software (between
4 to 7 years) added a processing margin on top and come up with a
monthly price. But get this: This price is still based on their old
enterprise price supporting 100-500 different applications, not on a
single application! Therefore the ROI model that the business user is
looking for is not there. On top of it, you have Ian's situation of
server/software utilization. It is no wonder that more and more
companies are looking at Open Source software when they go to the
cloud.

If the Oracle's of the world do not pay attention, they are likely to
lose their dominance in a few years. It seems just like yesterday when
I was told, we are a complete Microsoft shop and everyone used MS
Software. Today 30% of the sales team have Macs and quite a few of the
developers and internal IT folks are running Linux. I would estimate
the MSFT adoption has dropped to about 50% in my current organization.
Is this the future for enterprise software vendors?
