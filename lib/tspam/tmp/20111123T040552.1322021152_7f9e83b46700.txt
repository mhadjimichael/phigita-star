Starting December 4, 2011, you will see the following name changes in the Guru Billing and Payment System...

   * SafePay Account > Cash Account
   * SafePay Invoice > Guru Invoice
   * SafePay Escrow > Safepay
   * SafePay Billing Code > Billing Code

These  new names are intended to provide clarity and, therefore, make the payment system easier to use.

Think about it... you can't use a credit card to deposit funds into your SafePay Account. You can only use check, e-check or wire transfer. Hence the change to "cash account."

These new names will help reinforce the differences between the two very distinct service propositions, escrow and invoicing.

Your tried and tested benefits... now with simpler names.
