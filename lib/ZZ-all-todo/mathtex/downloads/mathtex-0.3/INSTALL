INTRODUCTION
============

  Mathtex requires at a minimum python 2.3, numpy, libpng and freetype.
  The (optional) cairo backend--which provides support for SVG, PDF and
  PS output--requires PyCairo to be installed.

COMPILING
=========

  In order to compile mathtex you will need the development versions of
  FreeType, libpng and zlib available on your system.

  Once all of these have been installed mathtex can be compiled and
  installe as follows

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

  It is possible to install mathtex on a per-user basis by using the
  --home argument. For example, to install mathtex just for the current
  user

    python setup.py install -home=~

  This has the advantage of not requiring root privilages.

  As mathtex is still beta-quality software it is not available via any
  distributions package management systems.
