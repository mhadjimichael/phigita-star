The ustring C++ Unicode library provides a set of class 
(http://ustring.sourceforge.net)

Description :

 ustring targets the complete conformance of the Unicode 3.0
standard. It gives an easy access to the properties of each of the
10600 characters defined by the Unicode 3.0 standard (such as
uppercase or lowercase mapping, category and subcategory, character
name, bidirectional category, etc.). It provides an stl-compliant wide
string class, which implements a full Unicode normalizer, uppercase or
lowercase transformation, diacritical marks removing, etc. A Unicode
level-1 Regular Expression class is also provided.
