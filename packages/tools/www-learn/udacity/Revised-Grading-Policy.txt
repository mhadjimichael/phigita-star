Revised Grading Policy

Dear Udacians,

We are changing the grading policy for both courses. The new policy is: if your final exam score is better than your homework average, your final grade for the course will just be your score on the final. Otherwise your grade will be the average of your grade for the final and your grade for the homework.

We hope this will make the homework a little less stressful. Additionally, this will allow students who had their homework misgraded to still earn a perfect score.

A large motivation for this decision came from the helpful feedback that you all provided on the forums. Thank you for the input, keep learning!
