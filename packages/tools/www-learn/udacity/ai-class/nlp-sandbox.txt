I used Markov chains. First I scanned a corpus and found the probabilities of letter trigrams. Then I created a metric to evaluate how "close" two strips are by multiplying their probabilities according to the trigrams. Eg if the first line of the strips contain "Th" and "eo", then I evaluate P('e'|'Th') * P('o'|'he'). Using this method I found the closest pair of strips and started iterating from there. Did it in about 55 lines of Python - https://github.com/vivekn/nlp-sandbox/blob/master/aiclass2.py
