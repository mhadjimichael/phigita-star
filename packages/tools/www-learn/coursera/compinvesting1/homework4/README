In the HW4 instructions, it says that for a $5 event, starting with $50,000, you should get a total return of "around
9%".

If you use actual_close to generate the orders, but adjusted close for the simulator, you should get around 9.6% (which
is closer to 10% than 9%).

That approach won't help you with the quiz. When taking the quiz, both the order generator and the simulator should use
actual_close. With that regime, the total return becomes 6.228% for the $5 event/$50,000 scenario.

Using actual_close for both the order generator and simulator, and starting with $100,000, here are total returns for
different trigger events:

$6 : 7.303%

$8 : 16.22%

$9 : 16.394%

$11 : 16.944%
