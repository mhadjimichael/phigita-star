<h1>SMS and the PDU format</h1>
<br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The SMS message, as specified by the <a href="http://www.etsi.org">Etsi</a>
organization (documents GSM 03.40 and GSM 03.38), can be up to 160 characters 
long, where each character is 7 bits according to the 
<a href="default_alphabet.html"><i> 7-bit default alphabet</i></a>.
Eight-bit messages (max 140 characters) are usually not viewable by the phones as 
text messages; instead they are used for data in e.g. smart messaging
(images and ringing tones) and <a href="http://www.3glab.org/ota.html"> OTA provisioning of WAP settings.</a> 16-bit messages (max 70 characters) are used for Unicode 
(UCS2) text messages, viewable by most phones. A 16-bit text message of 
class 0 will on some phones appear as a <a href="alert.html">Flash SMS</a> (aka blinking SMS or 
alert SMS).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The PDU format</h3>
There are two ways of sending and receiving SMS messages: by text mode and 
by PDU (protocol description unit) mode. The text mode (unavailable on some phones) is just an 
encoding of the bit stream represented by the PDU mode. Alphabets may
differ and there are several encoding alternatives when displaying an SMS 
message. The most common options are "PCCP437", "PCDN", "8859-1", "IRA" and
"GSM". These are all set by the <a
href="http://www.fastlogic.co.za/faq59.htm">at-command</a> AT+CSCS, when
you read the message in a computer application. If you read the message
on your phone, the phone will choose a proper encoding.
An application capable of reading incoming SMS messages, can thus use text 
mode or PDU mode. If text mode is used, the application is bound to (or
limited by) the set of preset encoding options. In some cases, that's just 
not good enough. If PDU mode is used, any encoding can be implemented. 
<br>
<h3>Receiving a message in the PDU mode</h3>
The PDU string contains not only the message, but also a lot of 
meta-information about the sender, his SMS service center, the
time stamp etc. It is all in the form of hexa-decimal <i>octets</i> or decimal <i>semi-octets</i>.
The following string is what I received <i>on a <a href=http://www.nokia.com/phones/6110/index.html>Nokia 6110</a></i> when sending the message containing 
"hellohello" from <a href=http://www.mtn.co.za>www.mtn.co.za</a>.
<br>

</table>
<br>
This octet sequence consists of three parts: An initial octet indicating the length of the SMSC information ("07"), the SMSC information itself ("917283010010F5"), and the SMS_DELIVER part (specified by ETSI in GSM 03.40).
<br>
<br>
<i>Note: on some phones (e.g. Ericssson 888?) the first three (colored) parts are omitted when showing the message in PDU mode!</i>

</table>
<br>
All the octets above are hexa-decimal 8-bit octets, except the Service center
number, the sender number and the timestamp; they are decimal semi-octets.
The message part in the end of the PDU string consists of hexa-decimal 8-bit 
octets, but these octets represent 7-bit data (see below).
<br>
<br>
The semi-octets are decimal, and e.g. the sender number 
is obtained by performing internal swapping within the semi-octets 
from "72 38 88 09 00 F1"
to "27 83 88 90 00 1F". The length of the phone number is odd, so 
a proper octet sequence cannot be formed by this number. This is the
reason why the trailing F has been added.

The time stamp, when parsed, equals "99 03 29 15 16 59 08", where
the 6 first characters represent date, the following 6 represents
time, and the last two represents time-zone related to GMT. 
<br>
<br>

<h3>Interpreting 8-bit octets as 7-bit messages</h3>
This transformation is described in detail in GSM 03.38, and an <a
href="hello.html"> example of the
"hellohello" transformation is shown here</a>. The
transformation is based on the <a href="default_alphabet.html">7 bit default
alphabet</a> , but an application
built on the PDU mode can use any character encoding.

<h3>Sending a message in the PDU mode</h3>
The following example shows how to send the message "hellohello"
in the PDU mode from a Nokia 6110.<br><br>

<XMP>
AT+CMGF=0    //Set PDU mode          
AT+CSMS=0    //Check if modem supports SMS commands          
AT+CMGS=23  //Send message, 23 octets (excluding the two initial zeros) 
>0011000B916407281553F80000AA0AE8329BFD4697D9EC37<ctrl-z> 
</XMP>

There are 23 octets in this message (46 'characters'). The 
first octet ("00") doesn't count, it is only an indicator of the length of the 
SMSC information supplied (0).
The PDU string consists of the following:<br>
<br>

Length of SMSC information. Here the length is 0, which means that the SMSC stored in the phone should be used. <i>Note: This octet is optional. On some phones this octet should be omitted! (Using the SMSC stored in phone is thus implicit)</i>

<td>
The phone number in semi octets (46708251358). The length of the phone 
number is odd (11), therefore a trailing F has been added, as if
the phone number were "46708251358F". Using the unknown format (i.e. the
Type-of-Address 81 instead of 91) would yield the phone number octet sequence
7080523185 (0708251358). Note that this has the length 10 (A), which is even.
