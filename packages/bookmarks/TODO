* Linklog -- public/private links

* Marked Links -- starred/favorite links

* Labels

* Bookmarklet -- open popup window and get the page from the server. This 
		 allows us to upgrade the url-add page without any hussle.
		 Furthermore, it permits us to perform clustering during
		 the first hit in order to provide some default labeling for
		 the link. Finally, it avoids any trouble with url length
		 restrictions on some browsers (has not been checked).

* Social Bookmarks -- A good place to add Google ads, since users are visiting
		      the social bookmarks page in order to find some external
		      links.

- "Move To..."

- Editing Folders -- Make sure that children are moved together with the folder.

- Deleting Folders -- Make sure that children are deleted as well.

- Improve public view.

- Exported folders cannot be imported into Mozilla (the one that ships with Redhat 8.0)

- Recent Folders -- Top 10 Folders with recently hit bookmarks. Display a quick folder selection portlet in the add bookmark page, and a report in the history page. Here's what I'm thinking:

	* Recently used folders (visited bookmarks from these folders)
	
	* Recently added/modified folders 

- Move "Recently Used Folders" and "Frequently Used Folders" portlets to "Jump To Folder" page.

- When a folder is created while bookmarking a page, then set it as the default after returning to the "Add Bookmark" page.
