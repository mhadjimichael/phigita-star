	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Yet another try to fix
	the problem with equations that include other patterns. Removing spaces
	turned out to be a hack, i.e. it caused trouble with equations of the
	form ''$\neg p$''.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Fixed problem with
	equations that include other patterns. For example,
	''$f(x) = 2 *3 + 5* 8$'' includes '*3 + 5*' that triggered
	the enclosed text, i.e. '3 + 5', to be emphasized. Moved the math 
	equation handler before the style handler and modified it so that it
	removes all spaces from equations.
	

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Yet another effort to
	get paragraph indentation right. Several fixes.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Simplified empty
	paragraph check.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Important bug fix. We
	need to keep track of opening tags included when 
	''${this_indent_level} < ${prev_indent_level}''. Otherwise, paragraph
	indentation is lost.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Added support for
	headings in structured text. Text enclosed in double equal sign,
	i.e. ''=='', denotes headings. The depth level defines what type
	of heading should be used, i.e. ''<h2>'', ''<h3>'', etc. Also,
	there's	an option available for specifying the ''start_depth''.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Added support for 
	physically (hard) wrapping preformatted text paragraphs 
	(non-breaking lines are also wrapped). A continuation glyph/image
	is added at the end of each wrapped line.
	
	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Added support for
	multi-paragraph bullet items.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Added symbology for math
	equations in structured text. Text enclosed in single dollar signs 
	denotes formulas appear right in the text while if it is enclosed 
	within double dollar signs it denotes formulas that appear on their 
	own line (respectively, the math and displaymath environments in LaTeX).
	
	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Added switches that 
	define the behavior of 'stx_to_html'.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Changed verbose mode 
	symbology from single apostrophe to double. Single apostrophes are 
	used in Greek (probably, in other languages as well) to shorten words 
	either in the beginning or to the end of a word and thus conflicts 
	arise.

	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Fixed problem with 
	paragraph cutting when checking whether it starts with a bullet or 
	not. In particular, I've changed 
	''regexp {^[ \t\n]*([*o\-\#])[ \t\n]+([^\0\n]*)'' to 
	''regexp {^[ \t\n]*([*o\-\#])[ \t\n]+([^\0]*)'' -- note the missing 
	newline character in the second regular expression. The problem was 
	that, in a multiline paragraph only the first line was accounted in the
	result of the transformation.
	
	* tcl/StructuredText/StructuredText-procs.tcl: Fixed indentation 
	problem of nested sequences (same bullet) when intervened by other
	subparagraphs.
