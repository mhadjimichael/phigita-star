Security (Cookies)

    - "My recommendation would be to have a kernel parameter that would allow admins to define arbitrary text that would be prepended to the cookie name (ie. host_SID)." See this thread: http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=103972

Structured Text Manipulation

- Wrap text paragraphs that include non-breaking lines. Also, the wrap attribute in Internet Explorer (XP) does not seem to work. Try adding wrap="true" for preformatted text.

- Text enclosed in triple dashes is striked out.  

- Bug: The following text does not appear in verbose::

        ''timestamp 'now'''

- Paragraph break is &\#182;

- Pound is &pound; &cent;

- &copy; &reg;

- Extend preformatted text symbology, i.e. ''::'' with '':song:'' to
  denote that the follow-up is a song. That would enable us to have
  attributes for the preformatted text. In our example (a song),
  we could have ''@author'' or ''@composer'', etc. These attributes
  would be accounted while restructuring the text.

- Add symbology for books, i.e. "some text":isbn:0-201-83595-9. 
  For example, "The Mythical Man-Month":isbn:0-201-83595-9.

- Allow user to write expressions of the form ''"an attached object":img:???''
  or ''"an attached object":???:??? in order to attach an image or an
  arbitrary object, respectively.


- Math equations problem with spaces, e.g. ''$\not fly$''.

- Plain links do not work except when there's leading text...

- Debug Aspect of Structured Text Manipulation, i.e. show a small icon when the user has entered an invalid ISBN or if you see a book definition with isbn that is syntactically invalid.

- Motivation to use the isbn tag is that in the future a user will be able to add that book into his wishlist by clicking on an icon that will appear next to the book link. Similarly, implement 1-click buy.

- Motivation for quote tag is "Quote Roll", i.e. for every quote that you use in a text (e.g. blog entry) it would be registered and roll every now and then on your website.

- Processing Instructions in Structured Text

- Property setters e.g.:

	* @author Neophytos Demetriou

	* @see "phigita.net: Homepage":http://www./phigita.net/

- Tables




- "output is a link, This is a web page":http://www.phigita.net/

- "output is a link, This is an email":mailto:nkd@ucy.ac.cy

- "output is a link, This is a book":isbn:0060953500

- "output is a link, This is a group":group:comp.ai.news

- "output is a link, This is a directory":directory:12345

- "output is a link, This is a product identified by a universal product code (UPC)":upc:0123456789

- "output is a link, This is a movie":movie:0123456789


- "output is an image, this is the caption of the image":image:814-123

- Images

  o Check the relevant directory for the given image address and find an 
    appropriate image size for the image to be included in the text.


==Preformatted Text and the like==

Preformatted text supports directives (e.g., setters) like @author, @date, etc.

- Use a trailing :: for preformatted text in the next indented paragraph.

- "Neophytos Demetriou":quote::

	Here is the actual quote

- "Title of the song":song::

	The Lyrics

- "Title of the poem":poem::

	The poem

- "This is the name of your program":code::

	The program, Motivation of writing your code like this is that it will get highlighted and links added for specific commands to the manual.

- "This is the name of your graph":graph::

	dot specification of the graph

- "This is for a csv table":csv::

	Your comma separated values here, first line is the title
	Similar tags: tsv (tab separated values), ssv (space separated values)


- "This is for a xxx table":xxx::

	Your values in the format, 
	DN: value1
	AS: asfd
	QW: asdf

	DN: asdf
	AS: asdf
	QW: asdf

	... and so on

- "This is for advanced users, latex eqnarray":eqnarray::

	Your latex eqnarray


==ORSL==

ORSL stands for Object-Relational System Layer.

- Support for message passing (i.e. call a proc) and inclusion of a proc (i.e. evaluate that proc in this context).
