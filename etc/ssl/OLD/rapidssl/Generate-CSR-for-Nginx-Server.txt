Login to your server via your terminal client (ssh). At the prompt, type:
ooppeennssssll rreeqq --nneeww --nnooddeess --kkeeyyoouutt sseerrvveerr..kkeeyy --oouutt sseerrvveerr..ccssrr
where server is the name of your server.
This will begin the process of generating two files: the PPrriivvaattee--KKeeyy file for
the decryption of your SSL Certificate, and a certificate signing request (CCSSRR)
file used to apply for your SSL Certificate. This command will prompt for the
following X.509 attributes of the certificate:
    * CCoouunnttrryy NNaammee ((CC)):: Use the two-letter code without punctuation for
      country, for example: US or CA.
    * SSttaattee oorr PPrroovviinnccee ((SS)):: Spell out the state completely; do not abbreviate
      the state or province name, for example: California.
    * LLooccaalliittyy oorr CCiittyy ((LL)):: The Locality field is the city or town name, for
      example: Berkeley.
    * OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn ((OO)):: If your company or department has an &, @, or any other
      symbol using the shift key in its name, you must spell out the symbol or
      omit it to enroll, for example: XY & Z Corporation would be XYZ
      Corportation or XY and Z Corportation.
    * OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonnaall UUnniitt ((OOUU)):: This field is the name of the department or
      organization unit making the request.
    * CCoommmmoonn NNaammee ((CCNN)):: The Common Name is the Host + Domain Name. It looks
      like "www.company.com" or "company.com".
       
Please do not enter your email address, challenge password or an optional
company name when generating the CSR.
Your .csr file will then be created.
